Use rbinom to simulate 10,000 replicates of 200 births. You should end up with 10,000 numbers, each one a count of boys out of 200 births. Compare the distribution of predicted numbers of boys to the actual count in the data (111 boys out of 200 births). There are many good ways to visualize the simulations, but the dens command (part of the rethinking package) is prbably the easiest way in this case. Does it look like the model fits the data well? That is, does the distribution of predictions include the actual observation as a central, likely outcome?\n\n```{r}\n#simulating 10'000 cohorts of 200 births to get the number of births from the posterior of estimations of the most likely true percentage of boys\ndummy_data_n_boys<- rbinom(1e5, size = 200, prob = samples)\n\nbreak_func <- function(x) {\n  length(seq(min(x), max(x), by = 1)) + 1\n}\n\nggplot() + \n  stat_histinterval(aes(x = dummy_data_n_boys), .width = c(0.66, 0.89), breaks = break_func) +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = n_boys), linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"red\") +\n  labs(x = \"Number of Boys\", y = \"Density\")\n```\n\n# 3H4.\n\nNow compare 10,000 counts of boys from 100 simulated first borns only to the number of boys in the first births, birth1.

To check this assumption, focus now on second births that followed female first borns. Compare 10,000 simulated counts of boys *(coming from the original model which assumes independence)* to only those second births that followed girls. To do this correctly, you need to count the number of first borns who were girls and simulate that many births, 10,000 times. Compare the counts of boys in your simulations to the actual observed count of boys following girls. How does the model look in this light?
