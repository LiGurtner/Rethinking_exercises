We build on the following efforts: \n\nWe read: [Rethinking Statistics, second edition](https://xcelab.net/rm/). The book has been \"translated\" into using [brms](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms) and the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) by [Solomon Kurz](https://bookdown.org/content/4857/), and we rely on his code. \n\nThere is a [lecture-series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cclUd_HoRlo&list=PLDcUM9US4XdMROZ57-OIRtIK0aOynbgZN&index=2) to go along with the book. \n\nTo the date of this writing, there are solutions to the excersises online, but only [using the original rethinking package](https://sr2-solutions.wjakethompson.com/bayesian-inference#chapter-2). In an effort to self-teach ourselves, we read the textbook and go through the exercises together. On this website, we collect our efforts. \n\nThe website was built using the [qrtAcademic template](https://andreaczhang.github.io/qtwAcademic/).\n\n\nA group of post-docs and phd-students at the Centre for Development and Environment at the University of Bern. \n\n# Disclaimer\n\nWe do our best but will make mistakes along the way. If you find them, congratulations! Also, please tell us, so we can fix them. \n\n# Licence\n\nCC-BC 4.0\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"Home.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","editor":"source","theme":"yeti","title":"Rethinking Stastistics - exercises"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
